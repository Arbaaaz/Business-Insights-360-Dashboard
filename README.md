# Business Insights 360 - Power BI Project

### About AtliQ Hardware Company
AtliQ Hardware is a global consumer electronics company specializing in hardware products such as PC mice, printers, and more. They supply these products to various retailers, including major stores like Microma and Staples, as well as online platforms like Amazon and Flipkart. These retailers then sell the hardware to end consumers like you and me.

### Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware expanded its operations to Latin America by opening its own stores. However, the company struggled to achieve success in this region. Despite rapid growth, they relied heavily on Excel files for data analytics, which proved inefficient and ineffective in generating actionable insights. This lack of robust analytics led to significant losses in Latin America.

To address this, the company decided to hire a data analyst to leverage their growing data and make informed, data-driven decisions.
